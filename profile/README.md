# Akka -- Build powerful reactive, concurrent, and distributed applications more easily

Akka is a toolkit for building highly concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications for Java and Scala.

*Akka is the implementation of the Actor Model on the JVM.*

### Simpler Concurrent & Distributed Systems

Actors and Streams let you build systems that scale up, using the resources of a server more efficiently, and out, using multiple servers.

### Resilient by Design

Building on the principles of The Reactive Manifesto Akka allows you to write systems that self-heal and stay responsive in the face of failures.

### High Performance

Up to 50 million msg/sec on a single machine. Small memory footprint; ~2.5 million actors per GB of heap.

### Elastic & Decentralized

Distributed systems without single points of failure. Load balancing and adaptive routing across nodes. Event Sourcing and CQRS with Cluster Sharding. Distributed Data for eventual consistency using CRDTs.

### Reactive Streaming Data

Asynchronous non-blocking stream processing with backpressure. Fully async and streaming HTTP server and client provides a great platform for building microservices. Streaming integrations with Alpakka.
